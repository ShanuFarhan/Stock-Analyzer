## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Analysis Not Appearing**
If the AI analysis doesn't generate after clicking "Analyze":
- **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure stable connection for API calls to Yahoo Finance and Gemini
- **Verify API Status**: The application includes comprehensive fallback mechanisms with mock data
- **Browser Console**: Press F12 → Console tab to check for any error messages
- **Try Different Symbol**: Test with popular symbols like AAPL, GOOGL, or TSLA

**Slow Performance**
If the application seems slow to respond:
- **Network Latency**: API calls may take 2-5 seconds depending on network conditions
- **First Load**: Initial application load includes resource caching for better subsequent performance
- **Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache with Ctrl+F5 if performance degrades over time
- **Multiple Requests**: Avoid rapid successive analysis requests to prevent API rate limiting

**Mobile Display Issues**
If the interface doesn't display correctly on mobile devices:
- **Refresh Page**: The application is fully responsive and should adapt automatically
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure you're using a modern mobile browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- **Zoom Level**: Reset browser zoom to 100% for optimal mobile experience
- **Orientation**: Both portrait and landscape orientations are fully supported

**Theme or Visual Problems**
If colors or themes don't display correctly:
- **Theme Toggle**: Use the theme toggle button to switch between dark and light modes
- **Browser Support**: Ensure your browser supports CSS custom properties (all modern browsers do)
- **Cache Issues**: Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5 to reload all stylesheets

### Getting Help & Support

**Self-Diagnosis Steps**
1. **Browser Console Check**: Press F12 → Console tab to view any error messages or warnings
2. **Network Verification**: Ensure stable internet connection for external API calls
3. **Symbol Testing**: Try multiple stock symbols (AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA) and crypto symbols (BTC-USD, ETH-USD)
4. **Cache Clearing**: Refresh with Ctrl+F5 to clear any cached resources that might cause issues

**Advanced Troubleshooting**
- **API Rate Limits**: If you see "rate limit" errors, wait 1-2 minutes before trying again
- **Invalid Symbols**: The application gracefully handles invalid symbols with fallback analysis
- **Offline Mode**: The application works offline with mock data when internet is unavailable
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)

**Performance Optimization**
- **Optimal Usage**: Allow 5-10 seconds between analysis requests for best performance
- **Cache Benefits**: Repeated analysis of the same symbol uses cached data for faster response
- **Resource Management**: The application automatically manages memory and cleans up resources

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- **No Server Storage**: All data processed client-side
- **Local Storage Only**: Preferences saved locally
- **API Key Security**: Keys stored in browser local storage
- **HTTPS Recommended**: Use HTTPS for production deployment

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in request throttling
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on API failures
- **Fallback Data**: Mock data when APIs unavailable
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated

## 🚀 Deployment

### Static Hosting
